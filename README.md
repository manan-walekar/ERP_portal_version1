College ERP Portal â€“ Custom-Built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS  This is a fully functional College ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) Portal developed by me using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, built and tested entirely in Visual Studio Code (VS Code). The project is designed to streamline and manage various academic and administrative processes in a college environment, offering features like:

Student registration and management

Faculty access and subject assignment

Attendance tracking

Grade entry and result generation

Timetable scheduling

Admin dashboard with full control

I utilized ChatGPT and Blackbox AI as smart coding assistants to optimize certain logic implementations, refine UI components, and resolve debugging challenges, ensuring a cleaner and more efficient development process.

The portal emphasizes clean design, responsive layout, and intuitive navigation, aiming to enhance user experience for students, faculty, and administrators alike.
